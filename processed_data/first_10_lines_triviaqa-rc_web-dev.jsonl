Seeing the opportunity for success, both human and chipmunks make a pact for them to sing his songs.

They must find a new home and they end up at Dave's house. The only thing that makes them different is that they can talk and even sing. Dave Seville (Jason Lee) is a struggling song writer who has a great idea about making the chipmunks a new show act, singing his songs. The only thing is that you must remember is that they are chipmunks and they act like chipmunks by tearing up Dave's house and interrupting his love life. However, they also begin to bond as a family with Dave becoming like a Dad. The chipmunks become a big hit and superstars with cute voices and fancy dance moves. The record company executive Ian (David Cross) sees big money in his future and takes over the act and pushes Dave to the side. Dave must try to save his little family before they becomes a show biz disaster.\n(My Comment) I enjoyed this movie because it brought back good memories. I can't believe that their first song was recorded 50 years ago. They have that certain sound that just makes you smile when you hear them. You recognize their sound immediately. The animated characters of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore are lovable now as they were 50 years ago. I always liked it when Dave would scream the name of \"Aaaaalviiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnn!!!\" and Alvin would say \"OooooK!!!\" Those two words just make you smile. Children of all ages can see this movie without any problem. I am sure that all the parents will like it, and I know your child will, because it is a fun movie.

He came to Los Angeles in 1950, and appeared in the films Viva Zapata, Stalag 17, and Rear Window. Bagdasarian also worked as a songwriter, reaching the charts first in 1956, as his production of Alfi & Harry's \"The Trouble with Harry\" hit number 44. He later charted two solo singles (recorded as David Seville), \"Armen's Theme\" and \"Gotta Get to Your House.\" In 1958, Bagdasarian began experimenting with a novel technique -- recording normal vocals but then speeding up the playback on a tape machine. The process yielded the number one hit \"Witch Doctor\" in early 1958, and the phenomenon mushroomed later that year when his Christmas gimmick single \"The Chipmunk Song\" spent four weeks at the top of the charts. \"Alvin's Harmonica\" reached number three just two months later, and Christmas reissues of \"The Chipmunk Song\" charted in the Top 40 over the next four years. The Alvin Show premiered on prime-time television in 1961, with all voices supplied by Bagdasarian. It only ran for one year, but was a success in a Saturday-morning slot. Five more Chipmunks singles charted in the early '60s, and five LPs also did well, including a Beatles cover album in 1964.\nAlthough Bagdasarian died in 1972, his son Ross Jr. revived Alvin, Simon, and Theodore in 1979 on Saturday mornings and on the 1980 album Chipmunk Punk. The series became more popular than in the '60s, and albums of the Chipmunks singing country, Christmas, rock, and Hollywood favorites were big sellers, though they didn't enjoy chart success. Although the cartoon was no longer in production by the '90s, new Chipmunks records continued appearing, among them 1998's A-Files: Alien Files.\nIn 2007, a film series debuted with Alvin and the Chipmunks -- the first being so successful that it spawned three sequels: 2009's Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, 2011's Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, and 2015's Alvin and the Chipmunks 4. A revival of the TV series was also planned to premiere on Nickelodeon in early 2015. ~ John Bush, Rovi\nRelated Artists"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "David Seville"}]}

Richard Eyre directs the world premiere production, which opens at the West End's Aldwych Theatre on 19 December 2013\nStephen Ward\n© Getty Images\nThe much-anticipated world premiere of Andrew Lloyd Webber's new musical inspired by the Profumo Affair, Stephen Ward, will open at the Aldwych Theatre on 19 December 2013 (previews from 3 December).\nDirected by former National Theatre artistic director Richard Eyre , the show marks the first collaboration between Andrew Lloyd Webber , lyricist Don Black and playwright Christopher Hampton (who has written the book) since their 1993 musical Sunset Boulevard. Lloyd Webber and Black have also worked together on Tell Me on a Sunday (1980) and Aspects of Love (1989).\nThe 1963 Profumo Affair, one of the most notorious political scandals of the 20th century, takes its name from the Minister of War John Profumo, who reputedly shared a mistress, Christine Keeler, with a Soviet spy and went on to lie when questioned about it in the House of Commons. The headline-grabbing affair shocked society and rocked the self-righteous Conservative Government of Harold Macmillan, leading ultimately to the resignations of both Profumo and Macmillan and ushering in a new era, as the \"stuffy\" 1950s gave way to the \"Swinging Sixties\".\nRather than the more infamous players of Profumo, Keeler or Macmillan, however, the musical takes its name from, the person the press release refers to as the real victim of the affair: Stephen Ward, a libertarian osteopath and artist who introduced Profumo to Keeler at a country house party. He committed suicide on the last day of the court trial.\nAndrew Lloyd Webber\nThe Profumo Affair has previously inspired stage versions including Hugh Whitemore's 1997 West End play A Letter of Resignation, starring Edward Fox, and the 2007 fringe musical A Model Girl, starring Emma Williams. Casting for Stephen Ward has yet to be announced .\nThe premiere production is designed by Rob Howell with choreography by Stephen Mear , lighting by Peter Mumford and sound by Paul Groothuis . Stephen Ward, Lloyd Webber's first new musical since 2010's Phantom of the Opera sequel Love Never Dies, is produced by Robert Fox Limited and the Really Useful Group."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sunset Boulevard"}]}

The show, based on the classic 1950 Billy Wilder film, has book and lyrics by Don Black and Christopher Hampton .\nThe production follows in the Newbury tradition of using actors who double as their own musicians; John Doyle's production of Sweeney Todd was staged there in 2004 and subsequently played the West End's Trafalgar Studios and Broadway. The Tony-winning orchestrator of that production, Sarah Travis, who won the 2006 Tony Award for Best Orchestrations, is the musical arranger for Sunset Boulevard .\nThe production is directed and choreographed by Craig Revel Horwood, last represented in the West End by Flamenco Flamen'ka. He is also known for his work as a regular judge on the TV series \"Strictly Come Dancing.\" He has previously staged Hot Mikado and Martin Guerre at the Watermill.\nLondon’s original Norma Desmond when the show premiered at the Adelphi Theatre in 1993 was New York's original Evita, Patti LuPone , back on Broadway in a Tony-winning turn in Gypsy . For this run, Kathryn Evans – the last actress to play the title role of Evita in that show's original run at the Prince Edward Theatre – will play Norma Desmond. She has also played leading roles in the West End productions of Anything Goes and The Fix and in the U.K. tour of Aspects of Love.\nThe cast also features Dave Willetts (Les Miserables, The Phantom of the Opera in the West End) as Max Von Meyerling and Ben Goddard (who starred in Horwood's production of Martin Guerre at Newbury) as Joe Gillis. Also in the cast will be Elisa Boyd, Tomm Coles, Alexander Evans, Kate Feldschreiber, Sam Kenyon, Nick Lashbrook, Tarek Merchant, Laura Pitt-Pulford and Helen Power. The production is designed by Diego Pitarch, with lighting by Richard G. Jones and sound by Gary Dixon.

Photograph: Ian West/PA\nThursday 20 December 2012 10.28 EST\nFirst published on Thursday 20 December 2012 10.28 EST\nClose\nThis article is 4 years old\nAndrew Lloyd Webber has revealed that he will collaborate with Don Black and Christopher Hampton on his new musical about the Profumo affair , which has been rumoured for months but now looks likely to happen.\nYesterday, Canadian newspaper the Globe and Mail broke the news that Black and Hampton would contribute the book and lyrics between them. Their involvement means the new musical will reunite the team behind Lloyd Webber's 1993 musical Sunset Boulevard , which originally ran for four years in the West End, despite briefly closing after mixed reviews. When the musical premiered on Broadway, Black and Hampton won the Tony award for best book.\nUntil now, that project has been Hampton's only collaboration with the composer, though he has worked on two other musicals: Dracula, also with Black, and the ill-fated Rebecca, the Broadway production of which collapsed this year after its major investors were found to be inventions .\nBlack and Lloyd Webber have a longer history of working together, having collaborated on the 1979 song-cycle Tell Me On a Sunday and, four years later, Aspects of Love .\nIn February, Lloyd Webber told BBC Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans that his next project would follow osteopath Stephen Ward's part in the collapse of Harold Macmillan's government . Ward was the man who introduced the then secretary of state for war John Profumo to Christine Keeler. He was subsequently charged with living off the \"earnings of prostitution\", and took an overdose on the penultimate day of the trial, dying in hospital four days later after charges had been dropped.\nFurther hints about the project emerged in September, when Lloyd Webber told the Times he was interested in exploring what he called this \"terrible miscarriage of justice\" .\nDescribing the musical, he said that it was still early days: \"It's a matter of getting the shape, making it dramatically secure.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sunset Boulevard"}]}

At the Shubert Theatre.\nWHEN Andrew Lloyd Webber announced plans to make a musical out of Billy Wilder's 1950 film classic, \"Sunset Boulevard,\" people wondered how it would translate to the stage. Scenes like the famous opening, with a corpse lying face down in a pool, would be as hard to stage as a car chase.\nBut when you have a source this rich, it makes sense to adapt it faithfully. And Webber and his collaborators, Christopher Hampton and Don Black (book and lyrics), are helped by the technical wizardry of production designer John Napier, who developed some of the most elaborate sets ever seen.\nWebber's musical, a revamped version of the production currently running in London (starring Patti LuPone), opened recently in Los Angeles, the first of his shows to bypass New York in its American premiere.\nGlenn Close stars as Norma Desmond, and the actress triumphs over the formidable challenge of playing a role created by Gloria Swanson. Close gives an oversized performance, filled with the grand gesture that is perfectly suitable to a former silent-film actress who is now living in a fantasy world. But the actress also humanizes the character, making her delusion more touching and making the relationship between her and desperate screenwriter Joe Gillis more credible, if less Grand Guignol. Close, who is no stranger to musicals (\"Rex\" and \"Barnum\") is also a powerful singer, delivering bravura versions of Webber's soaring melodies.\nWebber's music permeates the show, creating a near-operatic effect, and the composer has not lost his gift for memorable melodies. …\nSubscribe to Questia and enjoy:\nFull access to this article and over 10 million more from academic journals, magazines, and newspapers\nOver 83,000 books\nAccess to powerful writing and research tools\nArticle details\nSubscribe to Questia and enjoy:\nFull access to this article and over 10 million more from academic journals, magazines, and newspapers\nOver 83,000 books\nAccess to powerful writing and research tools\nArticle details"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sunset Boulevard"}]}
